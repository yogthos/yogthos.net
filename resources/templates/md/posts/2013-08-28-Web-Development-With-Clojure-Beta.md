{:title "Web Development With Clojure Beta",

I'm happy to announce that [Web Development With Clojure](http://pragprog.com/book/dswdcloj/web-development-with-clojure) has finally reached beta and it's now available for purchase.

The book covers working with the core Ring/Compojure stack, common libraries as well as techniques for accomplishing common tasks. My main goal is to make the reader comfortable with the Clojure ecosystem and demonstrate how to take an application from inception all the way to deployment.

It's been a long journey to get to this point and I learned much along the way. This book is my way to share that experience with you and hopefully save you time when working on your projects.

There's still some clean up left to do and you might see a few typos here and there. However, there won't be any changes to the core content at this point and I hope that you'll be curious enough to take a look. :)
